## 2-1 What are testcontainers?


Testcontainers refer to a concept and set of tools that facilitate the creation and management of disposable containers for testing purposes. While the original Testcontainers library is primarily used in the Java ecosystem, the concept itself can be applied to various programming languages and frameworks.

The core idea behind Testcontainers is to provide a lightweight and isolated environment for running tests that require external dependencies. These dependencies can include databases, message queues, web servers, third-party APIs, and other services that an application relies on.

By using containers, which are lightweight, isolated instances of software environments, Testcontainers allows developers to create consistent and reproducible testing environments. Containers can be easily spun up, configured, and torn down programmatically, ensuring that each test runs in a clean and controlled environment.

Testcontainers leverages containerization technologies like Docker to manage the lifecycle of these containers. Docker provides a platform for packaging applications and their dependencies into standardized containers that can be run on any system.
